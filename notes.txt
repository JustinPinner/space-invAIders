/speckit.specify Build a game with Typescript that runs in a web browser. The game is fully contained on a single screen that can be resized with the browser. The top part of the display will show the number of lives the player has on the left, the name of the game, Space InvAIders, in the centre and the current score on the right. Below this area is the play field which can be divided into three uneven blocks: the topmost block allows a single UFO sprite to enter the display from the left or right, chosen randomly, and proceed towards the opposite side of the display at a constant rate where it will leave and disappear. In the next block down we draw six rows of 8 sprites representing aliens. These are computer controlled non-player characters. The next block down is the city. In this block we draw five rectangles evenly sized and spaced. These represent buildings. The next block down is the lowest and is where we display the player's sprite that should resemble a cannon which points directly upwards to the top of the screen and can be moved left or right by the player. The aliens can drop bombs which will gradually destroy the buildings with each hit, or cause the player to lose a life if the cannon is hit. The player can shoot missiles upwards which can also gradually destroy the buildings, or instantly destroy the alien characters, or the UFO depending on what it hits. As soon as a bomb or missile hits something it is itself destroyed and removed from the game. Each alien is worth 100 points. The UFO is worth 200.
